        <h3>1.1 Introduction to NUS FSAE</h3>
        <p>
          Formula SAE (FSAE) is an international intervarsity competition organized by the Society of Automotive 
          Engineers (SAE) International, where universities from around the world design, manufacture, and race 
          formula-style cars. Each vehicle is evaluated through a series of dynamic and static events that assess 
          its design, cost, and performance. All cars must strictly comply with the safety standards set by the 
          judges, which are thoroughly inspected during the technical scrutineering process. 

          The National University of Singapore (NUS) FSAE Team entered the Electric Vehicle (EV) category in 2022
          and, by 2025, achieved an impressive 7th-place finish among 86 teams — the best result in the team’s history.

        <h3>1.2 Introduction to Lap Time Simulation</h3>
        <p>
          Lap Time Simulation (LTS) is a computational tool used to predict a vehicle’s maximum on-track
          performance based on its design parameters, enabling teams to make data-driven design decisions.
          Previous members of the NUS FSAE Team had attempted to develop similar tools in past years, though
          none were built in a systematic or scalable manner. The most recent version of the self-developed LTS
          tool was authored by me, beginning in May 2024, and is based on a two-wheel (bicycle) vehicle model.

        <h2>2. Problem Definition</h2>
        <p>
          The demand for a Lap Time Simulation (LTS) tool in a motorsport team is significant,
          as it allows detailed evaluation of a vehicle’s performance without the need for physical testing
          — some of which can be difficult or costly to conduct. Such a tool helps identify suboptimal design
          options early in the development process, reducing design iterations and overall costs. Therefore, it is 
          essential for NUS FSAE to develop an in-house LTS tool to support race car design and setup decisions. 
        </p><p>
          The previous version of the LTS tool, developed in the last season and named LTS25, was based on a two-wheel 
          (bicycle) model with three degrees of freedom. Its algorithm relied heavily on iterative methods, resulting in 
          long computation times per simulation run, with the processing load scaling with the number of mesh points in 
          the track model. Moreover, due to its inability to handle multivariable problems directly, the tool required 
          numerous simplifying assumptions, making it difficult to extend to more complex vehicle models. Consequently, 
          a complete overhaul of the core algorithm was necessary to improve accuracy, efficiency, and modularity. 
          The new Lap Time Simulation tool developed under this initiative was named LTS26.

        <p>
          Last season, the team focused on improving the dynamic performance of the car and successfully 
          finished all dynamic events in top 10. While this marks a substantial achievement, the team also 
          sees a big room for improvement and hence decided to continue focusing on enhancing the car’s dynamics 
          performance. Therefore, the team goal of this season was set as:  
        </p><p style="text-align: center;">
          “Extract maximum performance through improved reliability” 
        </p><p>
          To facilitate this, the goal for Lap Time Simulation department was set and therefore the Design Statement of the system:

        <p>
          LTS26 was constructed with more than 2000 lines of code on MATLAB. It utilizes Nonlinear Optimization 
          method with the help of CasADi to evaluate vehicle performance at around 500 query points with extrapolation
           to generalize it. It outputs insightful results for any dynamic events in the competition with less than half the computation time as 
          the previous tool, including lap time, car speed over distance, accelerations, etc.

          <h3>4.1 Revamped Structure</h3>
          <p>
            One of the main reasons LTS25 having slow computation speed was that its processing time scaled
             directly with the number of mesh points in the track model. For instance, a long track modelled with 
             high precision could contain around 1,000 data points — meaning 1,000 individual calculations would need 
             to be performed. At each of these points, the simulation independently evaluates the vehicle’s ability to 
             corner, accelerate, and brake. As a result, the simulation output is updated sequentially, point by point, 
             as the calculations progress.

            subtitle="Figure 2: LTS25 Simulation Structure"></image-component> 
          <p>
            To reduce computation time, the new framework was designed to evaluate vehicle 
            performance independently of the racetrack. Instead of calculating the vehicle’s behaviour point by point along the track, 
            the simulation first generates a comprehensive summary of the vehicle’s performance for a given setup — known as the Performance 
            Envelope — which can then be applied to any racetrack the team wishes to simulate. Since a race car’s maximum performance varies 
            under different conditions, a generalized envelope is constructed by evaluating the vehicle across a range of operating conditions, 
            followed by interpolation between these data points. Further details of this process are explained in the following sections.

          <h3>4.2 What should a Performance Envelope be like</h3>
          <p>
            A Performance Envelope of a racing vehicle should comprehensively describe the maximum limits of its dynamic performance across 
            all possible operating scenarios. These limits are constrained by both tire dynamics and the available traction from the powertrain 
            system. In the design of LTS26, the Performance Envelope is represented by the vehicle’s G-G-V Diagram, which characterizes its 
            acceleration capabilities in longitudinal and lateral directions at varying speeds, 
            and to evaluate the vehicle’s performance limit, the racing tires should be focused first.
          </p>

            <h4>4.2.1 Tire Traction Circle </h4>
            <p>
              The tire is the only component that connects the vehicle to the ground, determining how much force can be transmitted to generate 
              acceleration or deceleration. The tire’s grip, represented by its coefficient of friction, is limited and generally constant under 
              steady-state conditions. This available grip can be utilized in the longitudinal direction (x-axis), the lateral direction (y-axis), 
              or as a combination of both. Consequently, when the available friction is distributed between these two directions, the resultant force 
              capability forms a circle. This relationship is known 
              as the Friction Circle, a fundamental concept in racing tire dynamics.

            <h4>4.2.2 G-G Diagram</h4>
            <p>
              While the Friction Circle defines the grip limits of the racing tires, a race car’s overall dynamic potential is also constrained by 
              other subsystems beyond the tires. For an FSAE vehicle, its achievable acceleration is sometimes capped below the tire’s theoretical limit. 
              To translate the tire-level performance limits into actual vehicle behaviour, it is necessary to construct a G–G diagram for the vehicle. 
              This diagram captures the combined effects of all major systems — including aerodynamics, powertrain, 
              and suspension kinematics — to represent the car’s true performance envelope.

            <h4>4.2.3 G-G-V Diagram</h4>
            <p>
              Many of a vehicle’s performance characteristics vary with speed. For instance, aerodynamic downforce increases with the square of the 
              vehicle’s velocity, which in turn affects the normal load on the tires and consequently alters the shape of the G–G diagram. As a result, 
              the G–G diagram changes with speed, reflecting different performance limits at different operating conditions. Therefore, it is essential to 
              account for the G–G diagrams across the entire speed range of the vehicle to
               obtain a complete and accurate representation of its overall performance.

            subtitle="Figure 6: G-G Diagram at different speeds"></image-component>
            <p>
              By combining the G-G Diagram at all speeds that a vehicle could possibly run at, it is possible to obtain a full three-dimensional graph 
              that covers the vehicle’s dynamic limit in all conditions, the G-G-V Diagram.

            <p>
              Ideally, the vehicle should operate along the boundary of this diagram, and any point within it indicates that the driver is not extracting 
              the car’s full potential. Therefore, the objective of the simulation is to accurately determine the 
              G–G–V diagram for a given setup of the FSAE race car — which fundamentally defines its Performance Envelope.

          <h3>4.3 How to obtain the Performance Envelope</h3>
          <p>
            To derive a Performance Envelope that accurately represents the FSAE vehicle’s dynamic performance limits, 
            the steady-state behaviour of the vehicle at a 
            given speed must first be evaluated, ultimately leading to the construction of the G–G–V diagram. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the vehicle system consists of numerous interdependent equations and unknown variables, evaluating 
            each equation individually would be both complex and computationally inefficient. Instead, the problem is 
            solved using numerical optimization, which allows simultaneous evaluation of multiple decision variables.  
            In this work, an open-source tool for nonlinear optimization and algorithmic differentiation tool, CasADi, 
            was used (Joel A E Andersson, Joris Gillis, Greg Horn, James B Rawlings, Moritz Diehl, 2019),
             coupled with the Interior-Point Optimization Method (IPOPT) as the chosen solver.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonlinear programming is the process of solving an optimization problem where some of the constraints are not linear equalities 
            or the objective function is not a linear function. In the context of a 2D problem, the goal is to find the global minimum point over a 
            specific domain. The problem becomes significantly more complex as the number of variables and constraints increases.
          </p>
          <br />
              <image-component tag="image" source="assets\images\Visualization of non-linear optimization.jpg"
            subtitle="Figure 8: Visualization of non-linear optimization"></image-component>
          <p>
            To perform nonlinear optimization using a solver such as IPOPT, the problem must first be formulated by defining the decision variables, 
            objective function, constraints, initial guesses, and numerical bounds. CasADi then symbolically constructs the optimization problem and 
            interfaces with IPOPT to compute the optimized decision variables and their corresponding objective function value. 
          </p>
          <br />

            subtitle="Figure 9: Functional block diagram of the nonlinear optimization methodology"></image-component>
          <p>
            Therefore, to obtain accurate vehicle dynamics simulation results using CasADi, all input parameters must be correctly defined at each 
            iteration. In this case, the objective function consists of a comprehensive set of vehicle dynamics equations that describe the behaviour 
            of the model. Meanwhile, the initial guesses and optimization constraints are 
            defined based on the actual physical limits and operating conditions of the race car.

          <h3>5.1 Steady-State Simulation</h3>
          <p>
            As discussed earlier, the first step in the simulation process is to find out the dynamic limit, in both longitudinal and lateral, 
            of the vehicle under a steady-state condition. In other words, to find out the G–G diagram of the vehicle at a specific speed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first design iteration of achieving this goal was to maximize the lateral acceleration (Ay) at each swept Ax values. To begin with, 
            the maximum and minimum values of Ax must be found first by setting Ay to zero at both of their optimization framework. Initial guesses of 
            the relevant decision variables are set according to straight-line conditions as well to provide a closer guess. The program then generates 
            a mesh grid of Ax, and for each iterated Ax, optimize for the maximum value of Ay. This will output a set of Ax and Ay values, 
            forming the G-G diagram as demanded.
          </p>
          <br />
              <image-component tag="image" source="assets\images\First Prototype Visualization.jpg"
            subtitle="Figure 11: First Prototype Visualization"></image-component>
          <p>
            However, this design has notable limitations. It requires at least three separate nonlinear optimization setups within the program, 
            making maintenance and updates cumbersome. Furthermore, testing revealed that the 
            initial query points for Ay often experienced a high rate of optimization failure due to tight constraints.
          </p>
          <p>
            To tackle the issue and optimize the design, a second design was proposed. The optimization problem no longer seeks for optimizing either 
            decision variable Ax or Ay, but a grip factor P by│P│=√(〖Ax〗^2+〖Ay〗^2 ), which measures the total acceleration of the vehicle. As the aim 
            is to find the combination of maximum longitudinal and lateral acceleration, the problem was essentially converted to maximize the value of P. 
          </p>
          <br />
              <image-component tag="image" source="assets\images\Second Prototype Visualization.jpg"
            subtitle="Figure 12: Second Prototype Visualization"></image-component>
          <p>
            The program first defines an angle variable, θ (Theta), and generates a mesh grid ranging from π to –π. Using this, a constraint is applied 
            such that Ax/Ay = tan(θ) at each point of interest, ensuring that the iterations are evenly distributed across all directions of acceleration. 
            For each iteration, 
            the decision variable P is then maximized, and a corresponding set of optimized (Ax, Ay) values is obtained as the output. 
          </p>
        <div id="sub-section-5-2"></div>
         <h3>5.2 Quasi-Steady-State Simulation</h3>
          <p>
            By repeating this process for each vehicle speed, a Quasi-steady-state simulation can be completed, meaning the process of performing of 
            Steady-state simulation at multiple different states. 
            This will construct a full G–G–V diagram by combining the G-G diagram obtained at different speeds. 
          </p>
          <br />
              <image-component tag="image" source="assets\images\Simulated G-G Diagram at different speeds.jpg"
            subtitle="Figure 13: Simulated G-G Diagram at different speeds"></image-component>
          <p>
            The G-G diagram calculations were performed at speeds ranging from 10 meters per second up to the vehicle’s maximum theoretical speed, 
            with a constant increment of 1 meter per second. Speeds below 10 meters per second were excluded, as the vehicle is unlikely to operate 
            in that range during dynamic events, and its behaviour at such low speeds differs significantly, often causing the optimization solver to 
            fail. Instead, extrapolation 
            was applied to extend the G-G-V diagram and estimate the vehicle’s performance below 10 meters per second.
          </p>

          <h3>5.3 Optimization Success Rate</h3>
           <p>
            At each point of interest, numerical optimization is performed to determine the optimal set of decision variables. Since a general 
            configuration of numerical constraints and initial guesses is applied uniformly across all instances, certain optimizations may fail 
            due to infeasibility or nonlinearity. To prevent these failures from interrupting the overall simulation process, a try–catch structure 
            is implemented, allowing the program to skip any failed instances automatically. At the end of the simulation, a success rate is computed 
            as the ratio of successful optimizations 
            to the total number of optimization attempts, providing a metric to access the credibility of per simulation.
           </p>

            subtitle="Figure 15: Flow chart of optimization in loop"></image-component>
           <p>
            To increase the success rate, several additional design choices were implemented. For example, at each optimization query point, the 
            initial guesses for the decision variables are set to the optimized values obtained from the previous query point. This ensures, first, 
            that the optimization problem remains feasible because the initial values come from the program rather than arbitrary human guesses, and 
            second, that the initial guesses are close to the true solutions since consecutive query points are adjacent to each other. 
            Other examples include changing numerical constraints for certain decision variables at higher speed regime.

        <div id="sub-section-5-4">
          <h3>5.4 Speed Profile</h3>
           <p>
            With the vehicle’s performance limits established, it becomes possible to predict its dynamic capabilities on an actual competition 
            track, such as during the Endurance event. To achieve this, a Boundary Speed Profile (BSP) is first generated, representing the vehicle’s 
            maximum achievable cornering speed along the track, following by calculating 
            the maximum speed with limited acceleration and braking, which outputs the Limit Speed Profile (LSP).
           </p>
           <p>
            Using the interpolated G-G-V diagram obtained earlier, the program determines the maximum possible lateral acceleration, Ay, for each 
            speed value, which represents the vehicle’s peak cornering capability at that speed. The program then computes the minimum achievable turn 
            radius for each speed–acceleration combination. 
            The discrete results are then interpolated to generalize the data across all possible cornering scenarios.
           </p>
           <br />
              <image-component tag="image" source="assets\images\Cornering Speed against Radius.jpg"
            subtitle="Figure 16: Cornering Speed against Radius"></image-component>
           <p>
            The program maps the cornering speed to the corresponding turn radius if the specific segment has a turn radius less than 50 meters, else, 
            put the maximum vehicle speed. As such, the BSP was obtained.
           </p>
           <br />
              <image-component tag="image" source="assets\images\Track Model and Boundary Speed Profile.jpg"
            subtitle="Figure 17: Track Model and Boundary Speed Profile"></image-component>
           <p>
            Then, the objective shifts to determining the vehicle’s maximum possible acceleration at each point, to predict the highest attainable speed 
            at the next position after acceleration. Given the speed and turn radius from the BSP, since both speed and lateral acceleration are known, 
            the corresponding longitudinal acceleration, Ax, can be obtained from the G-G-V diagram.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, since the G-G-V diagram represents both acceleration and braking conditions, a given combination of speed and lateral acceleration 
            yields two possible Ax values — one positive (acceleration) and one negative (braking). Therefore, the G-G-V diagram must be divided into two 
            separate regions, 
            allowing the program to independently extract acceleration and braking data.
           </p>

            subtitle="Figure 19: Performance Envelope for Braking"></image-component>
            <p>
            Two separate for-loops were implemented to update the speed values derived from the Boundary Speed Profile. The first loop evaluates the 
            maximum possible acceleration at each instance using the Performance Envelope for acceleration, 
            and the second loop calculates the braking. As a result, the complete Speed Profile is obtained.

        <h2>6. Testing</h2>
        <p>
          The simulation results were tested and validated by comparing them against telemetry data from the NUS FSAE vehicle of the previous season, 
          R25E, recorded during the Endurance event at the 2025 FSAE Electric Competition. The lap time simulation using the newly developed LTS26 model 
          was conducted under identical conditions to 
          those of R25E, as well as the earlier LTS25 model, to ensure a fair and consistent comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          The simulation results showed that the predicted speed profile closely matched the telemetry data recorded during competition, both in overall 
          driving patterns and in maximum cornering speeds. The simulated results also reproduced similar acceleration and braking locations on the track 
          as those of the competition driver, 
          although the actual driver generally braked earlier due to risk management and individual driving style.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, discrepancies between the simulated and recorded speed profiles were observed primarily during acceleration phases and on track segments 
          with complex geometry. The program tended to overestimate R25E’s acceleration performance, as it was based on theoretical motor characteristics. 
          In reality, the powertrain system experienced significant 
          performance degradation due to thermal limitations and reduced efficiency during competition. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the simulation could not fully replicate the dynamic behaviour of a human driver in sections such as slaloms, 
          where the turn radius changes rapidly over short distances. The simulation seeks to minimize total lap time by accelerating whenever possible, 
          while a human driver prioritizes maintaining smooth and stable throttle control in these conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these limitations, LTS26 demonstrated a substantial improvement in computational efficiency. As a four-wheel quasi-steady-state model, 
          it required only about half the computation time of LTS25, which operated on a simpler bicycle model. This improvement not only fulfils the 
          development goals set at the beginning of the season but also highlights 
          the potential for future expansion of the vehicle model toward greater complexity and accuracy.

          <h3> 7.1 Optimization Success Rate</h3>
          <p>
            Although a few optimization failures can be compensated for through interpolation with neighbouring results, excessive failures lead to 
            distortions in the G-G-V diagram and prevent it from accurately representing the vehicle’s true performance. Therefore, reducing the number 
            of optimization failures is critical to improving the overall 
            accuracy of the simulation. This will be the key focus in the next stage of program optimization and development.

          <h3> 7.2 Model Complexity and Insights</h3>
          <p>
            The current version of the LTS26 Lap Simulation employs a four-wheel vehicle model but maintains only three degrees of freedom 
            (longitudinal motion, lateral motion, and yaw). Moving forward, the model will be expanded to include seven degrees of freedom by 
            incorporating the rotational speeds of all four individual wheels. Further development aims to extend the model to 
            fourteen degrees of freedom, allowing the suspension system of each corner to be represented independently.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the simulation tool will be enhanced to provide more comprehensive insights into vehicle performance beyond speed and acceleration, 
            including tire slip angles, optimal driver inputs, and aerodynamic maps, among others.
