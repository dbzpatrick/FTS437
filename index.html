        <h3>1.1 Introduction to NUS FSAE</h3>
        <p>
          Formula SAE (FSAE) is an international intervarsity competition organized by the Society of Automotive 
          Engineers (SAE) International, where universities from around the world design, manufacture, and race 
          formula-style cars. Each vehicle is evaluated through a series of dynamic and static events that assess 
          its design, cost, and performance. All cars must strictly comply with the safety standards set by the 
          judges, which are thoroughly inspected during the technical scrutineering process. 

          The National University of Singapore (NUS) FSAE Team entered the Electric Vehicle (EV) category in 2022
          and, by 2025, achieved an impressive 7th-place finish among 86 teams — the best result in the team’s history.

        <h3>1.2 Introduction to Lap Time Simulation</h3>
        <p>
          Lap Time Simulation (LTS) is a computational tool used to predict a vehicle’s maximum on-track
          performance based on its design parameters, enabling teams to make data-driven design decisions.
          Previous members of the NUS FSAE Team had attempted to develop similar tools in past years, though
          none were built in a systematic or scalable manner. The most recent version of the self-developed LTS
          tool was authored by me, beginning in May 2024, and is based on a two-wheel (bicycle) vehicle model.

        <h2>2. Problem Definition</h2>
        <p>
          The demand for a Lap Time Simulation (LTS) tool in a motorsport team is significant,
          as it allows detailed evaluation of a vehicle’s performance without the need for physical testing
          — some of which can be difficult or costly to conduct. Such a tool helps identify suboptimal design
          options early in the development process, reducing design iterations and overall costs. Therefore, it is 
          essential for NUS FSAE to develop an in-house LTS tool to support race car design and setup decisions. 
        </p><p>
          The previous version of the LTS tool, developed in the last season and named LTS25, was based on a two-wheel 
          (bicycle) model with three degrees of freedom. Its algorithm relied heavily on iterative methods, resulting in 
          long computation times per simulation run, with the processing load scaling with the number of mesh points in 
          the track model. Moreover, due to its inability to handle multivariable problems directly, the tool required 
          numerous simplifying assumptions, making it difficult to extend to more complex vehicle models. Consequently, 
          a complete overhaul of the core algorithm was necessary to improve accuracy, efficiency, and modularity. 
          The new Lap Time Simulation tool developed under this initiative was named LTS26.

        <h2>3. Design Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Last season, the team focused on improving the dynamic performance of the car and successfully 
          finished all dynamic events in top 10. While this marks a substantial achievement, the team also 
          sees a big room for improvement and hence decided to continue focusing on enhancing the car’s dynamics 
          performance. Therefore, the team goal of this season was set as:  
        </p><p>
          “Extract maximum performance through improved reliability” 
        </p><p>
          To facilitate this, the goal for Lap Time Simulation department was set and therefore the Design Statement of the system:
        </p><p>
          “Develop Lap Time Simulation software with correctness, accuracy and computational efficiency.”    
        </p>
      </div>

        <h2>4. Detail Design</h2>
        <div id="sub-section-1-header-1">
          <h3>4.1 Revamped Structure</h3>
          <p>
            One of the main reasons LTS25 having slow computation speed was that its processing time scaled directly 
            with the number of mesh points in the track model. For instance, a long track modelled with high precision 
            could contain around 1,000 data points — meaning 1,000 individual calculations would need to be performed. 
            At each of these points, the simulation independently evaluates the vehicle’s ability to corner, accelerate, 
            and brake. As a result, the simulation output is updated sequentially, point by point, as the calculations progress.  
          </p><p>
            To reduce computation time, the new framework was designed to evaluate vehicle performance independently of 
            the racetrack. Instead of calculating the vehicle’s behaviour point by point along the track, the simulation 
            first generates a comprehensive summary of the vehicle’s performance for a given setup — known as the Performance 
            Envelope — which can then be applied to any racetrack the team wishes to simulate. Since a race car’s maximum performance 
            varies under different conditions, a generalized envelope is constructed by evaluating the vehicle across a range of operating 
            conditions, followed by interpolation between these data points. 
            Further details of this process are explained in the following sections.
